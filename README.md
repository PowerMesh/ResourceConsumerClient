# Resource Consumer Client (RCC)

## Overview
RCC allows users to submit tasks that require GPU processing power and rent GPU resources from the Distributed GPU Sharing Platform. It automates the process of submitting tasks, tracking their progress, and retrieving the results.

## Components:

### 1. Task Submission Module

#### Purpose:
To allow users to submit tasks that require GPU processing to the Central Server.

#### Functionalities:

- **Task Creation**: Allow users to create a new task with input data and processing requirements.
- **Task Submission**: Submit the task to the Central Server for processing.
- **Task Tracking**: Allow users to track the status of submitted tasks.

#### Technology considerations:
- Implement data validation to ensure the integrity of the input data.

### 2. Payment & Billing Module

#### Purpose:
To manage the user's payments for renting GPU resources.

#### Functionalities:

- **Token Balance**: Display the user’s current token balance.
- **Token Purchase**: Allow users to purchase tokens with their blockchain wallet.
- **Billing**: Keep track of the costs associated with each task.
- **Payment Processing**: Deduct tokens from the user’s balance for task processing.

### 3. Result Retrieval Module

#### Purpose:
To retrieve and manage the results of the completed tasks.

#### Functionalities:

- **Result Download**: Allow users to download the results of completed tasks.
- **Result Management**: Provide functionalities to view and manage stored results.

#### Technology considerations:
- Store results in a structured format that can be easily accessed and analyzed.

### 4. User Interface (UI)

#### Purpose:
To provide users with an intuitive interface for submitting tasks and managing payments.

#### Functionalities:

- **Task Management Dashboard**: Provide a dashboard showing the status of submitted tasks, results, and costs.
- **Payment Management**: Display token balance, allow token purchase, and provide billing information.
- **Settings**: Allow users to configure settings such as payment preferences.

#### Technology considerations:
- The UI should be user-friendly and intuitive.
- Consider using a cross-platform GUI library.

### 5. Security Module

#### Purpose:
To ensure secure communications, protect user data and handle secure transactions.

#### Functionalities:

- **Secure Communication**: Use SSL/TLS encryption for communications with the Central Server.
- **Data Protection**: Encrypt sensitive user data stored locally.
- **Secure Transactions**: Implement security mechanisms for token transactions.

#### Technology considerations:
- Implement proper authentication mechanisms.
- Regularly update security protocols.

## Scalability and Performance

- The RCC should be designed to efficiently handle multiple tasks simultaneously.
- It should have a responsive UI that can adapt to different user loads and provide real-time updates.
